# New York City Taxi Fare data for 2013

## Instructions

### 1. Install [python](https://www.python.org/) and [sqllite](https://www.sqlite.org/)

I use 'sqlite3' and 'python 2.7+'. It is important to also get the 'sqlite3 package for python'.

### 2. Download raw Taxi data

The raw data can be found [here](http://www.andresmh.com/nyctaxitrips/). One needs to download and unpack the 12 Fare data files.
